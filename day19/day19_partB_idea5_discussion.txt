Notes on part B.  A lot of code was written earlier based on different approaches to the problem, but this is the latest approach.  Also note that the below is based on the part B example input, which I have labelled input_sample2.txt

Rule 42 possibilities:
aaaaa
aaaab
aaaba
aaabb
aabbb
ababa
abbbb
baaaa
baabb
babbb
bbaaa
bbaab
bbabb
bbbab
bbbba
bbbbb

Rule 42 8
Then creates a loop that creates a string where the five-characters above are put together as long as needed.


Rule 31 possibilities:
aabaa
aabab
aabba
abaaa
abaab
ababb
abbaa
abbab
abbba
baaab
baaba
babaa
babab
babba
bbaba
bbbaa

Rule 42 31 creates no loop.  It creates 10 character strings where the first five follow rule 42 and the second five follow rule 31

Rule 42 11 31 creates a loop where rule 42 occurs X times, followed by rule 31 occuring X times.

Strategy to solve the problem.  This sample has all substrings with length of 5.  I need to verify that each list of substrings (with length of 5) have no overlaps (i.e., no Rule#42 5-string is also a valid Rule#31 5-string)

The message string's length must be evenly divisible by 5 (if not ... reject it)

The message strings' first 5 characters must match something in Rule 42.  The second 5 characters also must match Rule 42.  After that, keep checking for all 5 characters matching Rule 42.  When a substring of 5 characters doesn't match 42, it must match Rule#31.  All subsequent substrings of 5 characters also must match Rule#31.  The total count of Rule#42 substrings must be at least one greater than the Rule#31 substrings.  The number of Rule#31 substrings must be at least one.  If all requirements described up until now are met, then it's a match ... otherwise it isn't a match.


The Rule 42 and Rule 31 possiblities need to be found for my actual data (instead the sample2 data), and then used in the program.  Note that all strings shown below are eight letters long (instead of five letters long)
